 * \brief A processor for incoming application-level events from hosts.
 *
 * This processor is used on compute nodes! It is called 'CLHostEventProcessor'
 * as it processes host events, i.e., events from the host.
 *
 * Event messages from hosts have to be processed differently as the IDs within
 * these messages refer to a particular host and, thus, are not unique if
 * multiple hosts are connected to a compute nodes.
 * Hence, a different event processor is required for each host that only
 * processes event messages it received from this associated host.
 *
 * In future version of dOpenCL, UUIDs could be used to assign globally unique
 * IDs to objects, such that an event processor does not have to consider the
 * event source to resolve these IDs. Then, CLHostEventProcessor and
 * CLComputeNodeEventProcessor can be merged into CLEventProcessor.
