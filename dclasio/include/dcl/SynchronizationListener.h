     * \brief Synchronizes (releases) the changes associated with this event wrapper's native event
     *
     * Summarizes two scenarios:
     * - a compute node has to synchronize its memory object because of a found
     *   event listener and performs an acquire operation. In this case,
     *   onAcquire is called on the host to answer the request of the compute
     *   node. This is necessary, since the compute nodes can't communicate
     *   among each other at the moment. \c process then is the requesting
     *   compute node.
     *   If available, the host sends the updated copy of the requested memory
     *   object to the requesting compute node. Otherwise, the host performs an
     *   acquire operation on the compute node being the owner of the event.
     *   This leads to the second case:
     * - onAcquire is called on a compute node, triggered by an acquire
     *   operation on the host. In this case, \c process is the host and the
     *   compute node's copies of all memory objects associated with the event
     *   are sent to the host.
     *
     * \param[in]  process  the process (host or compute node) that requested the synchronization
